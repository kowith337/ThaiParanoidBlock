Separate filter lists from a former [Thai AntiForceLike](http://pastebin.com/VU7275gQ) to block (third party) ads, tracking, monetisation, pop-ups that most used in Thai sites.

### Statement of this list
- I won't support **illegal** streaming sites, include anime, movies, series, named it!
  - You may look to other lists like
    - [AdBlock Thai](https://github.com/adblock-thai/thai-ads-filter) (Focused for uBO users and other proper forks)
	- [EasyList Thailand](https://github.com/easylist-thailand/easylist-thailand) (For ABP users due to I won't supported that extension)
  - If you having problem with those sites, report to one of two repo above (or both), I won't risk my life into the pitfall lair of ads and tracking! **(Indeed!!)**
- Any sites that was strictly blocked for certain reason (e.g. use as mobile download content) will cease to support and **no way to whitelist** for sake of prevent money loss and/or additional charge over mobile carrier!
